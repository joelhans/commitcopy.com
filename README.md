# Commit Copy

A NextJS- and Tailwind-powered website for [Commit Copy](https://commitcopy.com), which provides conversion copywriting
for open-source and B2B SaaS startups and companies.

This website is based on [joelhans.com](https://github.com/joelhans/joelhans.com), which is, in turn, based heavily on
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) from @timlrx. Many, many thanks
to them for the solid foundation, on-the-fly learning, and inspiration! If you're looking to launch an NextJS-powered
blog, I highly recommend the starter.

It's about much more than <span className="text-orange font-bold italic">hockey-stick GitHub star growth</span>. It's about consistent and transparent messaging that inspires people to latch on to your open-source vision.

## Source Story &amp;&amp; Commit-Ready Copy

The Source Story is my comprehensive research process that's like running a `git reflog` on your open-source business, unlocking your vision and understanding who's committed to your company and why. 

We then follow up with Commit-Ready Copy—a complete rewrite of your marketing website based on all our research. In the end, you have a marketing framework that I employ on your website and you can repeat, consistently and transparently, on GitHub, Discord, Discourse forum, or even contentious Hacker News threads.

*Source Story includes:*

- Brand story && values && and mission
- Customer, contributor, and community personas
- Voice of Customer / `Voice of Developer` research
- Your Source Story voice—think the tone, personality, and vocabulary you and your team use to talk transparently with your communities
- Concrete answers to tough open-source questions, like, "How do you prioritize the needs of your open-source community versus your customers?"

*Commit-Ready Copy includes:*

- Tagline development
- Website copy for up to 10 pages
- A Source Story "manifesto" blog post that puts your new messaging front and center when you're ready to `git push` all your new copywriting

## The One-Day Commit

A short timeframe can pack a big punch.

The One-Day Commit is perfect if you're a founder or a marketing professional at an open-source company that needs to tap the strategic expertise of a copywriter who understands your unique marketing challenges.

Once you commit to a day, we start with an intake form for you, a survey for your customers/contributors, and a 90-minute call to dial in your goals. The deliverables for your One-Day Commit are customized to those goals, but here's a few examples of what we can do:

- A website copy audit, with suggested improvements, for 5-10 pages
- Website copy for 2-3 pages (homepage, product, about)
- Content for your upcoming and all-important **Show HN** post

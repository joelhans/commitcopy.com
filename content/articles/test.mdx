And if you want to fully benefit from the hard work these folks put into the docs, it's time to start making some alliances. Why?

To do their jobs properly, these folks have to be well-versed in both your product and your audience(s), and they're dedicated to educating users to be more effective at day-to-day tasks while using your product. They're also likely not within the marketing team, but rather engineering or product, which means they're coming at your shared goals with a different (aka enormously valuable) perspective. When you feel like you're "too close" to your product to strategize content or craft compelling messaging, they can help you reframe and re-oriented toward real-world solutions and product-led thinking.

You also access a goldmine of content, like how-tos on performing a specific action (great for signup/retention emails!), deep-dive tutorials for beginners (TOFU, anyone?), and exceptional reference docs than serve as a pillar of your developer-focused brand marketing.

Engaging these folks to build alliances doesn't mean asking them to take on more responsibility or change how they write documentation to suit your needs. You need to understand their perspectives on the product, and their relationship to the users, to find a mutually beneficial path.

Here are a few ways to get involved that don't put more burden on these wonderful folks:

1️⃣ Get on GitHub (if you aren't already!), subscribe to the repository they work in, and follow along with their latest changes.

2️⃣ Look for opportunities to fine-tune any product messaging in the docs and take the initiative to make the changes yourself, even if that means editing Markdown, making a commit with Git, and starting a pull request.

3️⃣ Audit the docs for in-product partnerships and integrations that you can write about and promote to multiple communities.

4️⃣ Celebrate their work internally! Docs folks rarely get the credit they deserve, and making their work a little less thankless goes a long way.

With that relationship committed to and established, you'll have tapped into an endless stream of user-oriented, product-led content—and some great friendships too.

If documentation the biggest untapped resource for developer marketing, then how do you open it up?

Yesterday, I wrote about strategies for making alliances with the technical writers who document your products, including working with them on GitHub and celebrating their efforts, which are fundamental to a positive, efficient developer experience that benefits you all. Friendships and aligned efforts are fantastic, but you also need to respect the double-brick wall between documentation and developer marketing.

Documentation is strictly informational. 🧱🧱 Developer marketing is anything else.

To get any value from the docs, you need to do some legwork: Leap over that wall, pull out the information and insights with the most to offer your developer audience, and transform what you find on your way back over.

It's repurposing with a unique purpose. You get to freely insert brand messaging and conversion copywriting (which have no business in the docs), and can transform the content to focus on cohorts beyond the developers who are already users, like beginners who'll adopt and champion your product or leaders/CTOs who'll make the ultimate purchasing decision.

Unlike repurposing a conference talk into a blog post, or a blog post into a sequence of LinkedIn posts, transforming documentation into developer marketing content requires more than crunching longform content into a smaller shape. You're much more likely to expand what you find as you transform it into valuable content for your target audience.

Let's break down the major types of purpose-built docs you'll find (🔒) and how you'll need to transform them to unlock the developer marketing potential (🔓):

🔒: A step-by-step how-to guide for performing a specific task within the product, like enabling an integration with X.
🔓: A use case-driven blog post that details what your ideal developer can accomplish or the painful problem solved after they've enabled the integration with X.

🔒: An explanation of the unique approach your product takes to a complex issue, like GitOps.
🔓: SEO-driven pillar content for your website, enriched with more keywords, copywriting, and editorializing about why your approach is more useful than others.

🔒: Reference documentation for an API.
🔓: Social media posts—GIF are a goldmine here—to showcase how easily a developer can implement your API and get on with their life.

🔒: An in-depth tutorial educating the reader on both the product and a larger skill, methodology, or process.
🔓: A customer case study that parallels the tutorial's lessons and demonstrates the business value of having followed through.

Once you start wrapping the core value of documentation with your developer marketing finesse, you've unlocked a near-endless resource of developer content. And if you maintain your alliance with those folks, they'll start feeding you more ideas based on what they hear on the ground floor of educating and inspiring developers.

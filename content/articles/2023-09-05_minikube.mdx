  Your prerequisites:
  - A local system running macOS or Linux.
  - An understanding of how to open and use your OS' terminal feature.

## Introduction

Recently I [shared on
LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joel-hans_opensource-cloudnative-opensource-activity-7102290779787726848-sINF)
my recommendations on what someone new to open source `&&` cloud native, with a responsibility to actively _write_ about
the ecosystem, should learn first.

While I'd love for you to read the [whole
post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joel-hans_opensource-cloudnative-opensource-activity-7102290779787726848-sINF) and
chime in with your recommendations and additions over there, we're focused on a single item here:

> 8. Spin up a local Kubernetes cluster to see the fundamentals of software delivery in cloud native. Launch with
>    minikube and use kubectl to poke at it. Install a sample app with Helm, then add ingress with nginx or ngrok.

My reasoning here isn't that writers/educators necessarily need a high degree of practical working knowledge&mdash;most
folks in open source or cloud native won't need to leverage these skills regularly&mdash;but rather discovering empathy
through awareness. When you've experienced the pipeline yourself, you can better write to and for those who live it day
to day.

_Writer_ is, admittedly, an imprecise description of who I believe should have this fundamental knowledge. I'm not
limiting my definition to only those with _writer_ or _content_ in their titles, as pretty much every marketing, DevRel,
or product-centric role requires a non-zero amount of public-facing writing. The net is wider than you might assume&mdash;do you fit into one of these personas?

- **Content leads** building relevant and captivating funnels.
- **Technical writers &amp; documentation leads** drafting cloud native how-to guides or reference documentation.
- **Product marketing managers** owning product messaging across many channels.
- **DevRels** creating educational content for developer audiences in talks, on video, and beyond.
- **Copywriters** crafting more commitment-worthy landing pages, ads, and more.
- **Freelancers** of all walks honing their relevant and differentiating technical chops.

If so, let's take a journey through how the vast majority of end user applications are deployed to the cloud today. What
you use here won't make you a software developer or DevOps engineer, but it will give you insights into software
development in the cloud native era.

## Software delivery today: containers and clouds and Kubernetes

TK


Kubernetes is a container orchestrator, not a software delivery tool. It accepts configurations and containerized applications and 

Software delivery itself happens 

## The minimally viable know-how for open source && cloud native writers



### Step 1: Get your prerequisites

TK

Pick your operating system (OS):

<OsSwitch options={['macOS', 'Linux']} />

--

<OsWrapper>
<div key="macos">

1. **Install Homebrew**.

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

1. **Install `kubectl`**.

   ```bash
   brew install kubectl
   ```

1. **Install Helm**.

   ```bash
   brew install helm
   ```

</div>
<div key="linux">

1. **Install kubectl**. 

   ```bash
   curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
   sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
   ```

1. **Install Helm**.

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
   ```

</div>
</OsWrapper>

### Step 2: Install Minikube

TK

<OsWrapper>
<div key="macos">

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-amd64
sudo install minikube-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

</div>
<div key="linux">

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

</div>
</OsWrapper>





### Step 3: Deploy your first app to Kubernetes

### Step 4: Add ingress

**Positioning** and **messaging** are two discrete strategic concepts that every startup in cloud native `&&` open
source will have to nail, but you might find yourself slipping up here for a few common reasons:

- You think they're all just _branding_, which feels like a problem for more mature/more deeply-funded companies.
- You muddle the definitions of these concepts, leading to muddled strategy and execution.
- You swap the concepts entirely and then can't figure out why your target audience doesn't resonate with what you've
  built _or_ how you talk about it.

When your positioning is right, and it inspires empathetic and inspiring messaging, these concepts begin to work in
tandem to help you stride through those critical first few steps toward community, commercialization, and revenue.

## What is positioning?

Positioning is the clearest possible statement of _what your product is in its current state_.

Let's take some examples from companies I've been researching in platform engineering, application delivery, and Day 2
Ops. Some of these are pulled directly from their copy, while others are my _interpretations_ of their positioning.

- *GitLab*: <span className="font-medium text-purple">An AI-powered DevSecOps platform</span>
- Amazee: <span className="font-medium text-purple">A fully-managed application delivery platform</span>
- Rafay: <span className="font-medium text-purple">An enterprise-grade Kubernetes management platform</span>
- Codefresh: <span className="font-medium text-purple">A GitOps platform for cloud native apps</span>
- VMWare Tanzu: <span className="font-medium text-purple">A modular, cloud native application platform</span>

While we might disagree on which positioning statements are the "clearest possible," you can see how they would be
immediately understood by the companies' shared ideal customer&mdash;DevOps and platform engineers and the technical
leaders who manage them&mdash;and deliver some information about where it's _positioned_ within the existing market.

When your have clear and differentiated positioning, you have the first piece of your go to market (GTM) strategy: what
actions you're taking to convince people to pay for the product you've built.

## What is messaging?

First let's note what positioning _is not_. It's not what value your product provides, who it's for, the benefits it
unlocks for your ideal customers, or even the vision for your entire organization. These are all interpretive leaps only
possible once you have solidified your positioning.

It's worth repeating: You must be confident in your positioning _before_ you attempt a messaging project.

Messaging is the _ecosystem of strategy and language you use to pitch your product to different potential customers_.
Good messaging addresses all the things that positioning shouldn't, like who your product is for, how it's going to help
them, and why your organization exists at all.

I always begin messaging projects with a [brand story](/articles/brand-story), an internal wayfinding device that aligns
and inspires your people around what you're trying to do, which then informs the messaging ecosystem. You end up with a
framework document that codifies how your write and talk about your company in the following categories and beyond:

- A brand story
- A brand promise, a distillation of:
  - Who your organization serves
  - What your organization provides (mission statement)
  - Why your organization exists (vision statement)
- Ideal customer, developer, and community personas
- Voice and tone standards
- Unique value proposition (UVP) statements
- Boilerplate marketing messages, including:
  - One-liner
  - Elevator pitch
  - Corporate/PR message
- Key messages combining each ideal persona and UVP

Your messaging then percolates through every medium our output where you're writing or talking about your product.
That's website copy, promotional emails, social media, press releases, enterprise sales motions, GitHub READMEs, and
beyond.

## How being in cloud native && open source complicates the conversation

Closed-source and SaaS companies have one major tactical advantage here: They only need to worry about the positioning
and messaging of a single product. Maybe a small suite of products are aligned in their GTM strategy.

But when you're in cloud native or have committed to open source for other reasons, you need to understand and implement
these concepts twice over&mdash;once for your open source project, and again for its commercial counterpart. 

## Which one am I ready for?

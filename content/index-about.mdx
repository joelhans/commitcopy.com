*I'm an uncanny combination of creative knack and technical know-how.*

I'm a full-time open-source copywriter in Tucson, Arizona. I've been writing professionally for 12 years, with stints in tech, SaaS, manufacturing, publishing, and Silicon Valley-funded startups.

Often at the same time.

Since I started copywriting professionally in 2016, I've had the privilege of working with some of the biggest names in tech and SaaS, like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk.

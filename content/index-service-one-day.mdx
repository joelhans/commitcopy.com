A short timeframe can pack a big punch.

The One-Day Commit is perfect if you're a founder or a marketing professional at an open-source company that needs to tap the strategic expertise of a copywriter who understands their unique marketing challenges.

Once you commit to a day, we start with an intake form for you, a survey for your customers/contributors, and a 1-hour call to dial in your goals. The deliverables for your One-Day Commit are customized to those goals, but here's a few examples:

- A website copy audit, with suggested improvements, for 5-10 pages
- Website copy for 2-3 pages (homepage, product, about)
- Content for your upcoming and all-important *Show HN* post

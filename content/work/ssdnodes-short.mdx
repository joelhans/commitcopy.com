As the first marketing hire for SSD Nodes, I played an integral role in their copywriting and content strategy between
2017 and 2019. Major wins include growing the SSD Nodes blog by 3194.12% in just eight months and **doubling
year-over-year sales on Black Friday with an impactful landing page** that translated technical jargon into _I need that
upgrade right now_ value to existing customers.

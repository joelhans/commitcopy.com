## Netdata

I was a director-level technical writer and copywriter for this open-source infrastructure monitoring startup between 2019 and 2021.

My primary responsibility was the strategy and execution of technical content designed to **attract an ideal audience of
DevOps engineers and turn them into champions of Netdata's solution** by making them incredibly successful at their job. I produced hundreds of pieces of documentation, blog content, product copywriting, and more.

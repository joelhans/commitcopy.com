## Challenge

IMG SRVR visual file-sharing SaaS platform from Detroit, Michigan. They're building visual file-sharing platform specifically for creatives and the people they engage with professionally, such as PR agencies and potential buyers.

At the beginning, the assignment from the founder, Amani Olu, was simple: Write some transactional emails to engage new users of the SaaS's free tier and convert them into the paid tiers. I created messaging that taught them exactly how IMG SRVR solved their biggest pain points.

After getting the sign-off on the transactional emails, Amani offered up a more sophisticated assignment: Create a new brand for the company within just a few weeks to get them ready to launch the product ahead of Detroit Art Week.

## Solution

I worked with Amani to identify his company's mission, vision, core values, audience, and value proposition. We identified his ideal customer profile, followed by their top three pain points, and then I worked to define the cost (in money, time, and energy) if they don't fix those problems.

I wrote a brand strategy and vision that defined the new status quo that IMG SRVR enabled: PRs can boost their productivity, have more consistent and positive experiences with their clients, and ensure that journalists can access the story with ease to boost the likelihood of a successful placement.

Once we buttoned up the tone of the messaging, I crafted a homepage and features grid that resonates with these pains and teaches the true benefit of IMG SRVR. With the refined brand, Amani and his team were ready to get the website up and running, load up all the transactional emails into their backend, and launch with confidence.

Thank you, Amani, for entrusting me with the complexity of launching a SaaS brand!

## Challenge

Urbit is a ***unique*** entity that means a lot of different things to different people:

- Vision for the future of personal computing
- Open-source project with more than a decade of development history
- A peer-to-peer (P2P) network for building communities and subcultures
- Portable and permanent online identity system
- Computing kernel and programming language in just 30,000 lines of code
- Escape from computing's middlemen, who are driven by profit extraction and vacuuming up user data
- ... and more

The difficult work of unifying all those beliefs and demands falls on Josh Lehman, director of the Urbit Foundation,
responsible for marketing Urbit, growing and onboarding the userbase, and nurturing new developers onto Hoon, Urbit's
high-level, general-purpose programming language, through thoughtful educational content.

Creating a branding and messaging strategy that fits all these disparate users, needs, and hopes is no easy task.

That's when Josh reached out to me. He'd been chatting with a few highfalutin New York branding agencies, and while he
liked their vision, they were too strategy-focused. He needed a copywriter who could immediately translate Urbit's
complex technology into meaningful messages for each audience and a brand-new onboarding experience.

I launched a new VPS, installed Urbit, launched my ship, and got to work on Urbit's branding strategy.

## Solution

I sent a survey to current Urbit users to collect Voice of Customer data and jumped straight into my research on who
uses Urbit and what they love about it.

I understood that Urbit couldn't get away with multiple brand strategies&mdash;one for users, one for developers, one
for operators, and so on. Everyone on Urbit is a user first, having shared the exciting and often challenging process of
acquiring an identity, launching a ship, and connecting to the P2P network for the first time.

The project demands a singular vision, one that's rooted in technological advantage and specific enough to generate
commitment from users of all stripes, who then *evolve* into developers, operators, contributors, and more. We wanted to
represent the idea that Urbit aims to do nothing less than be the last computer you ever need to buy, set up, maintain,
and worry about.

This new vision: ***Urbit is your Final Computer***.

I applied my **COMMIT Framework**, starting with a brand story and branching off into personalized messages for each
type of Urbit user.

I got to work with a complete rewrite of Urbit's "getting started" onboard material, clarifying each step of the
admittedly convoluted process to guide users of various skills and ambitions onto the Urbit network for the first time.

We deployed the new onboarding material just a week before Urbit NYC Week, a decentralized gathering for anyone
interested in using or building on Urbit, which gave Josh the confidence and tactical advantage of a brand strategy
that's already deployed on Urbit's *most important content*.

## Examples of commitment-generating branding &amp; copy

- **Urbit is smart people, a permanent identity, and a vision for your Final Computer.**
- **Mission**: To build a modern operating system based on identity and peer-to-peer networking that helps users own
  their relationships, their interactions, and their data.
- **Sample web copy**:

  *Urbit is a new computing stack based on you owning your networks, identity, and data.* <br />With Urbit, you can
  discover brilliant subcultures, develop peer-to-peer apps without boundaries or middlemen, and contribute meaningfully
  to your Final Computer — a vision of personal computing as it always should have been.

  *Enter your Urbit today.* <br />Whether you’re a person in search of community, a developer in search of a new
  challenge, or something we’ve never seen before, Urbit has a space for you.

  *Develop on a personal OS designed from scratch to be peer-to-peer first.* <br />Urbit is the only OS, programming
  language, and deployment network that values getting smaller and getting out of your way. Your code, your ID, and the
  Urbit kernel reveal an entire network of audaciously smart people.

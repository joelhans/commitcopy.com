## Challenge

Urbit is a ***unique*** entity that means a lot of different things to different people:

- Vision for the future of personal computing
- Open-source project with more than a decade of development history
- A peer-to-peer (P2P) network for building communities and subcultures
- Portable and permanent online identity system
- Computing kernel and programming language in just 30,000 lines of code
- Escape from computing's middlemen, who are driven by profit extraction and vacuuming up user data
- ... and more

The difficult work of unifying all those beliefs and demands falls on Josh Lehman, director of the Urbit Foundation,
which is responsible for marketing Urbit, growing and onboarding the userbase, and nurturing new developers onto Hoon,
Urbit's high-level general-purpose programming language, through thoughtful educational content. 

Creating a branding and messaging strategy that fits all these disparate users, needs, and hopes is no easy task.

That's when Josh reached out to me. He'd been chatting with a few highfalutin New York branding agencies, and while he
liked their vision, they were too strategy-focused. He needed a copywriter who could immediately translate Urbit's
complex technology into meaningful messages for each audience and a brand-new onboarding experience.

I launched a new VPS, installed Urbit, launched my ship, and got to work on Urbit's branding strategy.

## Solution

I fired off a survey to current Urbit users to collect Voice of Customer data and jumped straight into my research on
who uses Urbit and what they love about it. 

I understood straightaway that Urbit couldn't get away with multiple brand strategies&mdash;one for users, one for
developers, one for operators, and so on. Everyone on Urbit is a user first, having shared the exciting, and oftentimes
difficult, process of acquiring an identity, launching a ship, and connecting to the P2P network for the first time.

The project demands a singular vision, one that's rooted in technological advantage and specific enough to generate
commitment from users of all stripes, who then *evolve* into developers, operators, contributors, and more.

The new vision: ***Urbit is your Final Computer***.

Josh and I collaborated on building a 




Josh and I collaborated on building a brand strategy around this concept, beginning with a brand story that expanded
into personalized messages for each type of Urbit user.

Josh now possessed not only a definitive brand strategy for Urbit's varied userbase, but also the tactical advantage of
fresh onboarding content to help users follow through on their commitment to Urbit's vision.

He traveled to New York City for Urbit NYC Week, a decentralized gathering of everyone who 


The purpose of Urbit NYC is to highlight and celebrate the many different builders and creators that are now part of our Universe.
New York is a perfect place for us to get together, for its dense but networked urban plan allows for people to hop around between various events throughout the bustling city. This also allows us to have a high degree of permeability with those that are Urbit-curious: people who need Urbit but might not know it exists yet.
We already have plenty of events in the works, but we want to do a real city takeover, and have more events than everyone can attend. There are many different facets of Urbit, and we hope the many events reflect that variety. There'll be technical events, launches, hangouts, and plenty of parties.

## Examples of commitment-generating branding &amp; copy

- **Urbit is smart people, a permanent identity, and a vision for your Final Computer.**
- **Mission**: To build a modern operating system based on identity and peer-to-peer networking that helps users own
  their relationships, their interactions, and their data.
- **Sample web copy**:

  *Urbit is a new computing stack based on you owning your networks, identity, and data.* <br />With Urbit, you can
  discover brilliant subcultures, develop peer-to-peer apps without boundaries or middlemen, and contribute meaningfully
  to your Final Computer — a vision of personal computing as it always should have been.

  *Enter your Urbit today.* <br />Whether you’re a person in search of community, a developer in search of a new
  challenge, or something we’ve never seen before, Urbit has a space for you.

  *Develop on a personal OS designed from scratch to be peer-to-peer first.* <br />Urbit is the only OS, programming
  language, and deployment network that values getting smaller and getting out of your way. Your code, your ID, and the
  Urbit kernel reveal an entire network of audaciously smart people.

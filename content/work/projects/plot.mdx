## Challenge

Megan Duong was, to borrow from the quote above, "eating shit." She hadn't even made it to the _eye of the storm yet_ as
the founder and CEO of [Sweater Story](https://www.sweaterstory.com/), a creative growth agency.

Sweater Story had no problems landing big-ticket clients for their messaging and branding services. They had a solid
network and did amazing work. The problem was everything that happened _after_ they started the job.

Clients suddenly wanted more out of the contract they'd already signed. They didn't give timely responses to review
&amp; revision windows, only to request complete do-overs once they finally did. Every project ballooned into something Sweater Story hadn't signed up for.

As hard as she tried, Megan couldn't stop these problems from trickling down to their network of freelance creatives
(including myself!). They experienced the pain of scope creep firsthand. Over and over again.

That's when Megan decided to pivot Sweater Story into a tech-driven SaaS company focused on solving problems around the
statement of work and scope creep for creative freelancers. She wanted to apply to YCombinator, but needed to nail her
positioning. Need a confident&mdash;dare I say bold&mdash;answer to _why do we need to solve scope creep?_

She turned to me for guidance on turning her company's vision into a "letter from the CEO" that would generate the right
commitment for her brand _right now_:

1. Commitment from YCombinator and angel investors who want to solve real business problems
2. Commitment from creative freelancers who <span className="text-orange font-medium">despise</span> scope creep and
   want to join the waitlist

## Solution

To start, Megan had just the "eat shit for a while" quote from one of her mentors. She knew she wanted to build off that
message, but didn't know how to finesse the transition from her own history as CEO of Sweater Story into the problem
space for creative freelancers.

We had a hour-long brainstorming session to discuss opportunities and drill into the deepest pain points of scope creep.
I joined the startup's product head for another session to relate my own pains and workarounds. By that point, we had
all the messages we needed.


Grateful to be trusted to help carry a new tech startup into its most important phase: launch.

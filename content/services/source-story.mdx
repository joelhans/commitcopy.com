The Source Story extends the comprehensive research process I bring to every copywriting project. It's like running a
`git reflog` on your open-source company, unlocking your vision and understanding who's committed to your company and
why.

A *Source Story project includes:*

- Brand story `&&` company values `&&` and mission/vision statements
- Customer, contributor, and community personas
- Voice of Customer `&&` **Voice of Developer** research
- Your Source Story voiceâ€”think the tone, personality, and vocabulary you and your team use to talk transparently with
  your communities
- Concrete answers to tough questions like, "How do you prioritize the needs of your open-source community versus your
  customers?"

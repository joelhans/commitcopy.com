This very website runs on a custom stack with NextJS, MDX, Tailwind, and Vercel, and it's [all
open-source](https://github.com/joelhans/commitcopy.com).

Vertical vs. horizontal scaling? Got it. Time-series databases? Been there. Running eBPF programs on the command line? Unfortunately, yes!

AI? ML? IoT? CI/CD? SRE? EDC? AIOps? I've written about it all.

I've launched LAMP stacks, written `docker-compose` files, and spun up Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

Heck, I've been a *desktop Linux user* for twenty years. I used to compile my own kernels on Arch Linux.

Your tech doesn't scare me.

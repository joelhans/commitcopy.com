### Creative, eh?

I spent two years immersed in storytelling while getting my Master's (MFA) in Creative Writing from the University of Arizona.

I learned storytelling techniques that don't get taught in marketing, communications, or business schools. It's more than applying a framework—it's about practicing creative intuition, collecting feedback, and discovering what works.

I've published dozen of stories in prestigious magazines. Here, take a peek at a personal favorite: ["A Man, His Oblations"](http://notokensjournal.com/fiction/a-man-his-oblations/).

I've done it all—except publish a novel. But don't worry, I'm working on that, too.

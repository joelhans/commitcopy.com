I'm a full-time open-source copywriter in Tucson, Arizona. I've been writing professionally for 12 years, with stints in
tech, SaaS, manufacturing, publishing, and Silicon Valley-funded startups.

Often at the same time.

Since I started copywriting professionally in 2016, I've had the privilege of working with some of the biggest names in
tech and SaaS&mdash; think IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk&mdash;to generate qualified leads, clarify their product
marketing, and build inseparable relationships with their audiences, whether they're customers, developers, or
contributors.

And if I can be self-aggrandizing for a moment...

<span className="text-sea text-lg font-medium italic">This is really quite difficult for me...</span>

I like to think of myself an uncanny combination of creative knack and technical know-how.

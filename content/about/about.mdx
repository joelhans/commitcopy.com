title: About Joel Hans, commitment-generating copywriting
summary: "I work with B2B, B2D (that’s business to developer!), and SaaS tech brands that need commitment from technical leaders, engineers, and developers."
---

Brands that understand that educating and sharing knowledge is the only way to drive commitments in a fast-moving,
competitive landscape.

That includes the behemoths in B2B, B2D, and SaaS, like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk. Plus startups like Netdata, IMG
SRVR, and Athens Research. And all the amazing in-betweeners, too, like Raygun, OpenText, Sumo Logic. Plus a dash of
web3 and decentralization with Radicle.

Why do they choose to work with me? <span className="text-orange font-semibold">Because I'm fueled by an uncanny
combination of creative knack and technical know-how.</span>

And if you’ve made it this far...

You should probably commit to some uncanniness.
